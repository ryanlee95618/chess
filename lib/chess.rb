Chess
runs the game
responsible for getting properly formatted input
keeps track of turns?, players


could keep track of timer



Game
validates moves sent from Chess



Board
holds all pieces (and taken pieces)

executes moves
looks for check, checkmate, stalemate
	needs to simulate moves to see if
		1. moving a player's piece would put that player's king in check
		2. moving a king put that king in check

Piece
has a team color
knows what move deltas are valid




types of invalid moves:
	
	-off the board / invalid coordinates ("H9", "Z5")
	-moving other players piece/ empty squares
	-invalid move for particular piece (rook moving diagonally)
	
	-moving through any piece (doesnt apply to knight)
	-moving onto own teams pieces
	-moves that put own king in check 



king  	diagonal and perpendicular, distance=1
queen		diagonal and perpendicular
rook		perpendicular
bishop	diagonal
knight	distance = 3 and not perpendicular
pawn		forward 2, no on in way and on first turn
			forward 1, no one in way
	 		diagonal 1, only if enemy on destination
	 		or if pawn "en passant"



NEED TO IMPLEMENT

check
checkmate
stalemate

pawn en passant (vulnerable after first forwarddistance 2 move)
# Another unusual rule is the en passant capture. It can occur after a pawn advances two squares using its initial two-step move option, and the square passed over is attacked by an enemy pawn. The enemy pawn is entitled to capture the moved pawn "in passing"â€”as if it had advanced only one square. The capturing pawn moves to the square over which the moved pawn passed (see diagram), and the moved pawn is removed from the board. The option to capture en passant must be exercised on the move immediately following the double-step pawn advance, or it is lost for the remainder of the game.
The capturing pawn must be on its fifth rank.
The opponent must move a pawn two squares, landing the pawn directly alongside the capturing pawn on the fifth rank.
You must make the capture immediately; you only get one chance to capture en passant.
